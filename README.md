## BRIEF — Los Pollos Hermanos

This test consists of the layout of a landing page with a time limit up to **72 hours** since this test has been received. You’ll have to simply stick to the following conditions:



* The content will be oriented to the famous fried chicken restaurant company “Los Pollos Hermanos” ([images](https://www.google.es/search?q=pollos+hermanos&tbm=isch), [info](https://breakingbad.fandom.com/es/wiki/Los_Pollos_Hermanos)).
* It’s important to highlight that their chickens are free-range chicken, and they will make you order more.
* The opening of a new restaurant will be held in Madrid, at Puerta de Alcalá.
* During a couple of weeks, the restaurant will be offering promotional drinks when ordering the food.
* The landing must be fully responsive, taking into account that the iPhone SE (320 x 568) will be the worst case scenario.

About the design and the style you’ll have enough freedom, but you must respect the branding and the aforementioned instructions.
